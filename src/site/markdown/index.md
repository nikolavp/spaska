A machine learning engineering system from Sofia university students.

## The problem
The problem we are trying to solve with this project is the slowness of weka. The project manages to make some of the algorithms not 
only faster but also with better performance(accuracy). The system also tries to be highly extensible, so you can plug in your own algorithms easily.


## Currently we have implemented the following:

### Clustering algorithms
* ZeroR
* K-Means
* [Fuzzy K-Means](http://home.dei.polimi.it/matteucc/Clustering/tutorial_html/cmeans.html)

### Classification algorithms
* K Nearest Neghbor
* Two Layer Perceptron
* ZeroR
* OneR
* Decision Tree
* [Naive Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier)

### Classifiers result analyzer
* Cross-Validation
* Wilcoxon's Test
* Paired T Test

### Data Preprocessors
* NormalizeValidator

### Documentation
Every one of these components has extensive documentation and we really try hard to keep it this way!
